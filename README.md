# Stock Knapsack Project

Software Engineering Tools (SENG 355) Group Project

## Project Requirements
- Clients have a list of stocks and a fixed budget to spend.
- Each stock has price, price increase probability, and expected new price.
- The initial budget of clients are $2,500.00.
- A greedy (pick highest earning possible first until budget is met) strategy will be implemented.
- The amount for the greedy algorithm will be calculated by multiplying the possible profit if the price was to increase by the expected new price.
- An optimal algorithm will be implemented which calculates all possibilities and chooses the option with the greatest reward.
- At least ten test cases will be created.
- A table will be created comparing the algorithm performance between the greedy and the optimal solution for various stock amounts.
